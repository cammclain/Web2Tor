# Web2Tor: Seamless Access to Tor from the Web

Web2Tor is a revolutionary tool that bridges the gap between the standard web and the Tor network. Built upon the robust Cloudflare Workers, it facilitates the direct access to a specific Tor hidden service without the need for a dedicated Tor browser. While primarily designed for website owners to harness the combined advantages of Cloudflare's DDoS protection and Tor's anonymity, it ensures that the user experience remains streamlined across standard web browsers like Chrome, Brave, and Edge.

## Key Benefits

- **Browser Neutrality**: Access Tor hidden services straight from your regular web browsers.
- **Single Service Focus**: Purposefully restricted to one onion service, preventing potential misuse.
- **Scalability and Speed**: Thanks to Cloudflare Workers, expect a high-performance and scalable experience.

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### Stage 1: Tor Client Configuration

Before diving into the Cloudflare setup, the groundwork requires setting up a Tor client:

1. Initialize a Tor client on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) or similar server platform.
2. Modify the Tor client to facilitate hidden service access.
3. Implement a web server or employ a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) ahead of the Tor client. This will manage HTTP requests, relaying them to the designated onion service.

### Stage 2: Cloudflare Worker Rollout

1. Access your Cloudflare account.
2. Head over to the 'Workers' segment and inaugurate a new worker.
3. Inject the provided JavaScript code into the Worker editor.
4. Modify the `TOR_CLIENT_ENDPOINT` and `ALLOWED_ONION_SERVICE` values in the script to resonate with your configuration.
5. Launch the worker and tie it to a specific route or domain.

## Hands-on Experience

Post-deployment, accessing the Tor service becomes straightforward. Use any standard web browser and input your Cloudflare Worker's URL. Ensure to attach the relevant path from the onion service you wish to access.

For instance:

`https://your-cloudflare-worker-domain.com/myonionservice.onion/page`

## Caveats and Legal Aspects

- **Privacy Trade-offs**: Leveraging Web2Tor might compromise the end-to-end privacy typically assured by the Tor Browser.
- **Exposure to Cloudflare**: The content of the Tor hidden service gets unveiled to Cloudflare and the underlying infrastructure sustaining the Tor client.
- **Legal Implications**: Prior to deploying Web2Tor, acquaint yourself with the legal landscape. It's paramount to recognize the potential legalities and accountabilities linked with provisioning such a service.
